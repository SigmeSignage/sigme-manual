# Weather Tiles

### Please note: This preview module has now been removed from the CMS and will no longer work. Please move to the [Weather](media_module_weather.html) widget to continue to provide weather information in Layouts.

The Weather Tiles Widget allows you to display current daily weather events as well as weekly forecasts using a service called [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) as a source of weather data.

## Installation

Weather data is provided by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) which is provided under [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/)

To get an API key please visit [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api) to create an account.

(If you are going to exceed 1000 calls per day you will also need to enter your billing information).

The Weather Tiles Module is installed from the Modules page, under the Administration section of the menu. Click on the **Install Module** button and select the Module to install.

After installation, select the Module from the grid and use the row menu to select **Edit**.

Complete the form fields and include the **API key**. The CMS allows a Cache period to be specified which will create a delay between requests for each geographic location.

Open Weather Map allows 1000 requests for a forecast, per day before charging a small fee for each subsequent request.

{tip}
**Paid plans** unlock a 16 day forecast as well as other optimisations in the way the data is pulled through.

- Templates must be designed at a fixed size
- All elements must use absolute sizing in px, including fonts, margins, widths, heights, etc
- If positioning is used, it must be from top,left
- Templates can use bootstrap
- The aspect ratio will be fixed by [[PRODUCTNAME]] and sized to fit the Region
- Templates are treated the same as a static image

### CSS Style Sheet

This is the CSS to apply to the template structure above.

## Attribution

All Layouts that use the Weather Widget need to include attribution, available by using the `[Attribution]` tag. All preset templates contain this tag by default, please ensure that this tag is included when editing/overriding default templates.

### Caching

Enter the Update Interval to be applied, in minutes, kept as high as possible. 

{tip}
If the data will only change once per hour the Update Interval could be set to 60.
{/tip}

### Get Forecast

It is possible to **request a forecast** at any time to see what forecast data is returned. Any field is available as a substitute in the template by entering the field name between square brackets - for example `[nearestStormDistance]`.
