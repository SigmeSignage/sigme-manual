When assigning audio to a Widget you can enter **Volume** as well as a **Loop** parameter to determine whether the audio will loop for the duration of the existing Widget or just play through once. The audio will be stopped when its parent Widget finishes playing.

Once audio has been assigned to a Widget, a **speaker icon** will be visible for the media item in the Region Timeline.
