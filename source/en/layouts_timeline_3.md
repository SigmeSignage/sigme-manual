# Layout Timeline

{tip}
**Please note:**

- If you are using a v3.1.x CMS, please click [here](layouts_timeline.html)

{/tip}

Each Region on a Layout has its own **Playlist** of content, which is shown in a specified order by a Player. 

A Playlist can consist of a **single item** (such as a company logo), or **multiple items** (such as an image slideshow).

{tip}
If you are using a version 2 CMS earlier than 2.3 please use the following link: [Layout Timeline](layouts_timeline_2.0.html).

If you are using 1.8.x CMS, please use the following link: [Playlists](layouts_playlists.html).
{/tip}

A Region's Playlist is viewed/edited in the **Layout Timeline** window.

The timeline clearly shows how each Regions assigned Widgets will play. The greyed out entries indicate what will play when that items own duration is exceeded.

{tip}
The above Timeline tells us the following:

**Text** determines the duration of the Layout, as the longest running Region with a 60 second duration.

**Image 1** will play for 10 seconds then **Image 2** will play for 10 seconds, this will repeat twice more to remain on screen for 60 seconds (until the Text Widget has fully played out)

**Clock** has a set duration of 10 seconds but will remain on screen for 60 seconds (until the Text Widget has fully played out)

{/tip}

The window to the left of the Region gives a preview of the Region positioning on the Layout. 

![Region Position Preview](img/v3_layouts_timeline_region_position_preview.png)

Clicking on a Region from the Region Preview will open the **Region Editor** and **Region Options** form to make edits.

You can also use the edit icon next to the Region Position Preview to open the editor and the Region Options form.

## Assigning Content

Use the toolbar on the Layout Designer to add [Widgets](layouts_widgets.html) or use the [Library Search](layouts_library_search.html) to add content that has already been uploaded to the Library.

{tip}
Widgets that are available can be enabled/disabled by an Administrator in the [Modules](media_modules.html) section of the CMS.
{/tip}

Once Media has been added, the timeline will automatically scroll to the newly added content (highlighted as green) for easy configuration.

{tip}
Drag and drop Widgets in a Regions Timeline to reorder the sequence they should play.
{/tip}

Use the timeline buttons to zoom in and out to decrease/increase the visible time span and use the blue scroll bar to see all assigned content in your Timeline.
