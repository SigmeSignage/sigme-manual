# Layout Timeline

{tip}
If you are using a CMS earlier than v3.1.0 please select from the options below:

- v3.0.x CMS click [here](layouts_timeline_3.html)

Each Region on a Layout has its own **Playlist** of content, which is shown in a specified order by a Player. 

A Playlist can consist of a **single item** (such as a company logo), or **multiple items** (such as an image slideshow).

A Region's Playlist is viewed/edited in the **Timeline** in the Layout Designer:  

![Region Timeline](img/v3_layouts_region_timeline.png)

The timeline clearly shows how each Regions assigned Widgets will play. The greyed out entries indicate what will play when that items own duration is exceeded.

The window to the left of the Region gives a preview of the Region positioning on the Layout. 

![Region Position Preview](img/v3_layouts_timeline_region_position_preview.png)

Clicking on a Region here will open the editor and show the available options in the properties panel.

{tip}
You can also use the edit icon to open the editor!
{/tip}

Click the back arrow in the top left of the viewer to exit the editor and return to the Layout view.

## Assigning Content

Use the toolbar on the Layout Designer to add [Widgets](layouts_widgets.html) or use the [Library Search](layouts_library_search.html) to add content that has already been uploaded to the Library.

{tip}
Widgets that are available can be enabled/disabled by an Administrator in the [Modules](media_modules.html) section of the CMS.
{/tip}

Once Media has been added, the timeline will automatically scroll to the newly added content (highlighted as green) for easy configuration.
