# Layout Timeline

{tip}
Please note: This page is for users of a **v2.0.x - v2.2.x CMS**. For an alternative version please select from the options below:

{/tip}

Each Region on a Layout has its own **Playlist** of content, which is shown in a specified order by the Player. 

A Playlist can consist of a **single item** (such as a company logo), or **multiple items** (such as an image slideshow).

{tip}
If you are using a v2.3 CMS or later, please use the following link: [Layout Timeline](layouts_timeline.html)

{/tip}

A Region's Playlist is viewed/edited in the **Layout Timeline** window.  Use the buttons to zoom through the timeline to see the full Playlist of content.

The Layout Timeline shows the duration of **Widgets** as well as the total duration of the **Layout**.

The timeline will show how each Regions assigned Widgets will play out. The greyed out entries indicate what will play when that items own duration is exceeded.

{tip}

The above timeline tells us the following:

**Text** determines the duration of the Layout, as the longest running Region with a 60 second duration.

**Clock** has a set duration of 10 seconds but will remain on screen for 60 seconds (until the Text Widget has fully played out)

**Image (1)** will play for 10 seconds then **Image (2)** will play for 10 seconds, this will repeat twice more to remain on screen for 60 seconds (until the Text Widget has fully played out)

{/tip}

The Layout status indicator shows if a Layout is valid and will play when scheduled (green tick)  **Invalid Layouts (red cross) will be excluded from the Schedule and will not be played.**

{tip}
A Layout must contain at least one Region **and** each Region must contain at least **one** media item for it to be valid and play when scheduled.
{/tip}

## Assigning Content

**Media items** that are assigned to Playlists are called **Widgets** which can be files stored in the [Library](media_library.html) as well as enabled [Modules](media_modules.html).

Use the toolbar on the Layout Designer to add [Widgets](layouts_widgets.html) or use the [Library Search](layouts_library_search.html) to add content that has already been uploaded to the Library.

{tip}
Widgets that are available can be enabled/disabled by an Administrator in the Modules section of the CMS.
