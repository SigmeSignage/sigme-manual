Layouts can be grouped together into an ordered list. A Campaign can then be **Scheduled** to play the grouped Layouts in a set sequence.

**Campaigns** are administered from the **Design** section of the CMS Menu.

### Folders

Campaigns can be optionally saved to [Folders](tour_folders.html) for easier searches, organisation and to easily set [Share](users_features_and_sharing.html) options for Users/User Groups

{tip}

### Name

Give the Campaign a **Name** for easy identification purposes within the CMS.

### Tags

Campaigns can be tagged to further organise and make it easier to find a large number of Campaigns if grouped by [Tags](tour_tags.html).

{tip}
Use the **With Selected** option at the bottom of the Campaign [grid](tour_grids.html) to edit Tag assignments in bulk!

- Layouts can be removed by clicking on the minus icon next to a Layout in the staging area.
- Re-order Layouts in the staging area by drag and drop to ensure that Layouts play in your designed sequence.
- Click **Save** to keep changes.

{tip}
Did you know that using **Display Order** when [Scheduling Events](scheduling_events.html) you can further control how your Campaigns will play on your Displaysâ€¦
{/tip}

{tip}
Use the **Copy** button located on the row menu to easily make a copy of an existing Campaign!
{/tip}

{tip}
Layouts can be directly assigned to Campaigns using the Row Menu, **Assign to Campaign**, on the Layouts grid. Layouts will be assigned to the end of the selected Campaign by default!
{/tip}

{tip}
Use the Row Menu to assign User/User Group access to selected Campaigns:

- Users of a 3.x CMS refer to the [Features and Sharing](users_features_and_sharing.html) page for further information.
- Users of a CMS earlier than 3.x refer to the [Permissions](users_permissions.html) page for further information.
