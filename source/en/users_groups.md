# User Groups

{tip}
If you are using a CMS earlier than v3.0.0 please use the following link: [User Groups](users_groups_2.html)
{/tip}

User Groups allow for a set of [Features and Share](users_features_and_sharing.html) options to be applied to all Users within a specified Group.

[[PRODUCTNAME]] comes with a set of pre-configured User Groups for common functions for new installations.

{tip}
Pre-configured User Groups are available for new v3 installations and for users who upgrade to v3 who have not previously utilised User Groups in earlier versions!
{/tip}

These Groups already have the required Features enabled to allow Users to carry out the chosen role, and can be modified if necessary.

{tip}
Using User Groups makes it easier to onboard new Users and manage system access. Users will inherit the [Features and Sharing](users_features_and_sharing.html) enabled for the User Group!
{/tip}

Create new and manage existing by clicking on **User Groups** under the **Administration** section of the menu.

{tip}
User Groups that you create can be enabled to be shown for the [New User](users_administration.html) onboarding wizard!
{/tip}

### General

- Use this tab to give your User Group an identifiable **Name**
- Assign a [Library Quota](tour_library_quota.html) to the group to determine the maximum amount of content allowed to be uploaded to the Library. Enter 0 if no quota should be applied. 
- Enable the **Notification** options if required for the Group.

### Description

Provide optional text to describe the created Group. 

{tip}
If enabled, this description will be shown for onboarding new Users and so should describe the Groups role to make it clear for selection!
{/tip}

### Onboarding Settings

This tab controls the options for onboarding new Users.

Once all tabs have been created click to **Save**.

## Group Members

Once created, Users can be assigned to the Group using the **Row Menu** and clicking on **Members**:
