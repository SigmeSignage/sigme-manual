**Please note:**

**Please note:** This module is currently not supported for the Linux Player.

The Audio Module allows for audio to be played when assigned to a Timeline. Audio files are uploaded to the [Library](https://xibo.org.uk/manual/en/media_library.html) which are then cached for off-line playback.

### Add Widget

Click on **Audio** from the [Widget](layouts_widgets.html) toolbar and click to add or drag and drop.![Audio Widget](img/v2_media_audio_widget.png)

If the audio file has already been uploaded to the Library use the [Library Search](layouts_library_search.html) tab to quickly and simply add!
{/tip}

### Upload Audio file

The file uploader will open on adding the Audio Widget:

- Click on **Add files** and select the file(s) to upload.

{tip}
Files can also be added via drag and drop!

{/tip}

Audio files can also be directly uploaded to a specified **Folder** location.

There is an option to set expiry dates and times for files uploaded to this particular Widget.

- Use the date picker to select **Start** and **End** dates and times.

- Further options are available to remove the Widget from the Playlist on expiry and to delete the media file from the Library.


- Click the **Start upload** button to begin the upload of all files added. If a Folder/Expiry Dates have been selected and there are multiple files to be added, all files will be uploaded to the specified location and have the same Expiry Dates set.
- Once successfully uploaded, click **Done**.

Files can also be uploaded individually and have different Folder locations/Expiry dates and times specified.
Instead of clicking on the Start upload button, click on the **blue upload** button shown at the end of the row for an added file. 

Change the Folder location using the **Select Folder** button as before and then click the blue button at the end of the row to upload just that singular file.

### Configuration Options

![Edit Options](img/v3_media_audio_edit_options.png)

- Make edits to naming of the Widget if required
- Here you can see how long the audio will play for. Tick the **Set a duration** to provide a specific duration.

{tip}
Set a lower duration than shown to cut the audio short or select a higher duration and use the Loop function!
{/tip}
