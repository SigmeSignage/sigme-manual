The Layout Designer is the heart of **content creation** in [[PRODUCTNAME]]. Each time a new Layout is added, or an existing one needs a design change, the Layout Designer is used.

[[PRODUCTNAME]] makes layout design simple through the use of **drag and drop**,**interactive previewing** and **design flexibility**. On adding a new Layout, the Layout Designer will open:

## Top Toolbar

A status indicator is shown to the left of the top toolbar to show you the current 'play' status of the selected Layout:

![Build Status](img/v2.3_layouts_build_status.png)- This Layout has not been built yet.

![Valid Status](img/v2.3_layouts_valid_status.png) - This Layout is valid and can be scheduled once Published.

![Invalid Status](img/v2.3_layouts_invalid_status.png) - This Layout is invalid and will not be Published for scheduling. 

![Assessed Player Side Status](img/v2.3_layouts_assessed_player_side_status.png) - This Layout contains media that can only be assessed Player side, and can be scheduled once Published. 

{tip}
This is a normal Layout status to have if your Layout contains online content, such as a webpage etc. The CMS cannot say that the Player will display the content as it is not sent directly from the CMS (as with file based media, images, videos etc,) and is instead cached (stored) Player side.  The Player will need to have a reliable internet connection to successfully display such content.

{tip}
Hover over the status icon to see further information regarding the status you are seeing!

The total **Duration** of the selected Layout is displayed here in seconds, which updates each time a media item is added or an existing duration is edited, along with the Layout **Dimensions** applied from the selected **Resolution** on the Edit Layout form.

![Layout Status](img/v2.3_layouts_layout_status.png)

{tip}
The overall Layout duration is always based on the longest running Region on the Layout.
{/tip}

{tip}
A Layout must contain at least one Region **and** each Region must contain at least **one** media item for it to be valid and play when scheduled.
{/tip}

### Layout Selector

To the right of the toolbar, the **Layout selector** provides easy navigation between all Layouts the logged in User has permission to edit without having to leave the Layout Designer screen. Use the dropdown menu to change the Layout you are currently viewing/editing.

### Actions Menu

Located next to the Layout Selector is a menu of **Actions** that can be performed for Layouts, depending on the status of the Layout.

### Layouts in a Draft status have the following available Actions:

![Draft Actions](img/v2.3_layouts_draft_actions.png)

- #### Discard

  Any changes made to the Layout can be completely discarded, reverting the Layout to the previous Published version. 

![Discard Layout](img/v2.3_layouts_discard_layout.png)

Clicking on Discard will delete the draft and leave the Published version untouched.

- #### Publish 

  Once you are happy with your designs, set your Layout to **Publish** ready to be Scheduled.

{tip}
Invalid Layouts will not be published. On publishing, an error message will show as to why your Layout is invalid, which you will need to rectify before being able to Publish.
{/tip}

â€‹	Layouts can be set to be **Published** straight away with updates automatically pushed to Layouts that are 	in the schedule. A **Publish Date** can also be selected to Publish a Layout at a specified date and time.

![Publish Selected Time](img/v2_layouts_publish_selected_time.png)

{tip}
You can also use the **row menu** for a selected draft Layout to set a **Publish time**.
{/tip}

Published Layouts can be viewed in a read-only mode and 'Checked out' to create a draft Layout to make any edits needed.

### Layouts in a Published status have the following available Actions:

![Published Actions](img/v2.3_layouts_published_actions.png)

- #### Checkout

  Enable editing by putting the published Layout into a draft status.

- #### Schedule Now 

  Schedule published Layouts onto one or more Displays directly from the Layout Designer.

- #### Save Template

  Save your published designs by creating a [Template](layouts_templates_2.html) for reuse. Saving a template will store an exact copy of the Layout, including Regions, Playlists and media.

## Layout View

As you create your Layout, the Layout View will update, so that you can view all the elements as you go to ensure the correct positioning of [Regions](layouts_regions.html) and the correct ordering of [Widgets](layouts_modules.html), so it will play as you intend.

![Layout View](img/v2.3_layouts_layout_view.png)

### Edit Layout Mode

All new Layouts, by default, have one full screen empty Region, represented as a semi-transparent overlay.  Use the **Edit Layout Mode** to add, position and resize **Regions**, by clicking on the Edit icon to open the editor.

![Layout Navigator](img/v2.3_layouts_layout_editor_icon.png)

Clicking on a **Region** in the opened editor, opens the **Region Options** form which allows for refinement of  **Positioning** and the application of **Exit Transitions** for when the Region finishes.
