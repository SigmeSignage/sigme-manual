Add the **Two Factor** column to the Users grid using the **Column visibility** button. This will give you an overview of what Users have set with regards to Two Factor authorisation. (Disabled / Email / Google Authenticator)

If you cannot access the CMS then run the following sql directly in the database to clear 2FA data for a specified User `{yourUserId}` , userId can be found in the User table.

```
UPDATE `user` SET `twoFactorSecret` = NULL,
`twoFactorTypeId` = 0,
`twoFactorRecoveryCodes` = NULL
WHERE userId = {yourUserId}
```

{/tip}

## Deleting Users

Delete a User in the same way by using the row menu for the selected User.
A confirmation form will open up and give you further options regarding the items currently owned by that User.

{tip}

Deleting a User is irreversible and will remove all their owned items including; Media, Layouts and Schedules, even if these items are being used by other Users in the system. **Reassign items** to another User using the selector to make them the new owner of all the items currently owned by the User you wish to delete. Alternatively, use the **Retired** checkbox at the bottom of the Edit User form so that the items remain in use in the system with the User unable to log in.

## My Applications

[[PRODUCTNAME]] contains an API that allows 3rd party applications to connect and consume its data. 

{tip}
**Add Applications** and **Add DOOH Applications** and configure from **Applications** under the **Administration** section of the main menu.

Before using an **Application** each User must authorise the application to act on their behalf within the CMS. Once  authorised it can be viewed by clicking on the **My Applications** button to open a current list.

At the current time the CMS does not provide individual Users with a method of revoking access to an application, however, an admin can remove an application completely.
