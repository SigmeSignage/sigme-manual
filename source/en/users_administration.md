Deleting a User is irreversible and will remove all their owned items including; Media, Layouts and Schedules, even if these items are being used by other Users in the system. **Reassign items** to another User using the selector to make them the new owner of all the items currently owned by the User you wish to delete. Alternatively, use the **Retired** checkbox at the bottom of the Edit User form so that the items remain in use in the system with the User unable to log in.
