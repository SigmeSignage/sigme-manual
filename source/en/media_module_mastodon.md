# Mastodon

Display Mastodon social feed content anywhere on a Layout using Elements or include Static Templates with pre-styled designs in Layouts/Playlists.

{feat}Mastodon|v4{/feat}

The Mastodon Widget returns content from the URL entered for the [Module](media_modules.html) which feeds into configured Elements and Static Templates.

## Mastodon Elements

[Elements](layouts_editor#content-data-widgets-and-elements) are available for selection when adding a Mastodon Widget to a [Layout](layouts_editor.html) to give Users more control over what components of the Mastodon Widget to use and where they can be placed.

Each Element has a set of configuration options in the Properties Panel. A **Hashtag** must be provided to return results from the **Configure** tab for each Element used on the Layout. Control how items should be cycled by specifying a [Data Slot](layouts_editor.html#content-data-slots) to use for each of the added Elements. Data Elements can be further complimented by adding [Global Elements](layouts_editor.html#content-global-elements) to add shapes and text which can all be put into an [Element Group](layouts_editor.html#content-grouping-elements) for easier configuration and positioning.

Take advantage of [Stencils](layouts_editor.html#content-stencils) to add a predesigned group of Elements to your Layout.

{tip}
All Elements in the Stencil are treated as ‘one’ when configured and can be easily duplicated from a right click!

## Mastodon Static Templates

[Static Templates](layouts_editor.html#content-static-templates) define how returned items should be laid out and styled and are a simple way to show items using pre-styled templates.

Templates can be configured to affect the behaviour of returned results as well as make changes to the design appearance using a range of options in the Properties Panel. A **Hashtag** must be provided to return results from the **Configure** tab for each Template added to the Layout/Playlist.
