## FAQ's

What are **Schedule Loops**? 

A Schedule Loop is how media content will play when in schedules with other media content. For example, if you have scheduled 2 media items each with a 10 second duration to be shown at the same time for 1 hour, both items will play for their 10 second durations in fair rotation for the scheduled time.

How do I remove an **Always Event** from the Schedule?

From the Schedule, use the row menu for the Event in the Grid view and select Delete, or click on the Event icon from the Calendar to open the Edit Event form and Delete.
