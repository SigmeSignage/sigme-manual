# Forms

**Please note:** If you are using a 3.x CMS, please use the following link: [Forms](tour_forms.html)

The CMS presents most transactions (actions that **add**/**edit** or **delete** in some way) using Forms.

The forms have been designed to be consistent across the application and provide as much information as possible.

A typical form looks like the Add Layout form below.

## Tabs

Forms can have 1 or multiple tabs. Access by clicking on the tab header, some may cause the form to expand to better fit the content inside them.

## Form Fields

Each field has a title that explains what the field represents. Each field will also have a grey explanation entry above or below it.

## Buttons

Every form has a button bar at the bottom for the User to commit or cancel the additions/edits they have made.

{tip}

Most forms also include a "Help" link to sections of the Manual for additional guidance.
