# Scheduling

[[PRODUCTNAME]] has a sophisticated scheduling system which allows for the simple creation of complex schedules for **Events** across Displays/Display Groups. 

## Events

Events are administered from the **Schedule** section of the menu and managed from the calendar interface.

The CMS supports scheduling for the following Event types:

1. #### Layout Event

   Select Published Layouts to schedule to Displays. 

2. #### Campaign

   Select Campaigns to schedule to Displays.

3. #### Overlay Layout Event

   Specially created [Overlay Layouts](layouts_overlay.html) are scheduled at the same time as existing Layouts to create an **overlay** of content to be displayed. 

4. #### Interrupt Layout Event (available from v2.2.0)

   **Please note:** Currently supported for Android from R204 and Windows from R253

   A Layout that is scheduled as an [Interrupt Layout](layouts_interrupt.html) will interrupt your usual schedule to fit around other scheduled Layouts to play for the specified **Share of Voice** percentage set.

5. #### Command Event

   A Scheduled Command can be executed by the Player at a specific point in time and therefore this type of event does not need a `toDt`.

Available [Commands](displays_command_functionality.html) can be selected using the **Command** drop-down menu on the **Schedule Event** form.

{tip}
Display Order and Priority are irrelevant when it comes to executing the Command, but may be set in the CMS for organisational purposes.

6. #### Action Events (available from v3.1.0)

**Please note:** Currently supported on Windows from v3 R303

**Actions** allows listening for webhooks independantly to Layouts. Users can schedule Action Events to **Navigate to a Layout** or run a **Command**.

## Schedule Events

Events are scheduled into **Dayparts**. Select from the two available options when configuring an Event:

- ### Custom


Create your own To/From dates and times.

- ### Always

Select to have the event run constantly.
{tip}
Create your own defined [Dayparts](scheduling_dayparting.html) for ease of scheduling. Once created these will show in the Dayparting drop down menu for selection!

## Priority

Use Event Priority to determine whether the event should be included in the schedule for the Player or not. A 'Priority Event' is determined by a number, with 0 considered the lowest Priority.

{tip}
If a Player has a schedule containing Events which are all Priority 0, then all of the Events will be shown in rotation together. 

If 1 of the Events has a Priority of 1, then this will be the only Event shown. 

If there are some Events with Priority 0, some with Priority 1 and some with Priority 2 only the Priority 2 Events will be shown, in a rotation for that Scheduled period (as the highest Priority)

A good example to use Priority would be in a way to alter the Schedule at a specific time, for example, a normal rotation during the day with a Priority Event at lunchtime which shows specific ‘lunch’ information (i.e. Lunchtime specials on a cafe menu).
