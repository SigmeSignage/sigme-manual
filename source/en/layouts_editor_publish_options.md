# Publishing Layouts

Once your Layout design is complete you must ensure that you **Publish** your Layout before Scheduling. Use the Menu located to the far right of the status bar to view all options for your Layout:

![Publish Menu](img/v4_layouts_publish_menu.png)

{tip}
Options shown are dependent on whether your Layout is in a **Draft** or **Published** status.

**Discard draft** to revert back to the previous Published version and discard all changes.
{/tip}

Layouts can be **Published** straight away to push updates automatically to Layouts that are already in the schedule. A **Publish Date** can be set to determine a specified date and time to Publish: 

![Publish Date](img/v4_layouts_publish_date.png)

{tip}
Administrators can use the default setting on the CMS **Settings** page to automatically **Publish** draft Layouts 30 minutes after the last edit.
{/tip}

{version}
Setting a **Publish Date** is not an alternative to scheduling. Your Published Layout will still need to be [Scheduled](scheduling_events.html)!
{/version}

## Checkout

Published Layouts can be edited by selecting to Checkout to create a draft of the Layout. 

{tip}
Users can select the 'auto submit' check box so that this form is [automatically sent](tour_cms_navigation.html#content-automatic-submission-of-forms) each time that **Checkout** is selected. 
{/tip}

Users can take their time with any edits that need to be made as a Layout in a draft status will not reflect any changes to the published version. Scheduled Displays will continue to show the Published version of the Layout. 

- Make the changes permanent and overwrite the existing Layout by selecting to Publish. Once Published Scheduled Layouts will show the changes made.
- Discard will revert the Layout back to its original published state, with no changes made to the Scheduled Layout.

{tip}
Use the row menu from the Layouts grid to access a list of actions and shortcuts!
{/tip}

## Unlock Layout

If a User attempts to edit a Layout that is already being edited by another User of the CMS, the Layout will lock to prevent editing by the User. The Layout will remain locked for a specified amount of time (as shown in the lock message) or until **Unlock Layout** is selected by the initial User.

{tip}
Users will be redirected to the Layout grid on unlocking a Layout to release it for another User to make edits.
