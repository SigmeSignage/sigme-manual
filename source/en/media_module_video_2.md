Once assigned to a Region, **Edit** options are available.

Choose to provide a specific duration:

- The video can be cut short by providing a lower duration.
- Wait on the last frame of the video or set the video to **Loop** (start from the beginning again) by providing a higher duration.

The Loop check box will appear once you enter a duration higher than the video to initiate the Loop functionality.
