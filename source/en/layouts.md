# Layouts

A Layout is a complete screen design made up of content, which is then scheduled to one or multiple Displays. A Layout can contain 1 or more items of content to show using a combination of Elements, Widgets and Library Media.

To show a sequence of multiple items (such as an image slideshow) on Layouts, a [Playlist](media_playlists.html) is used.

[[PRODUCTNAME]] has no limit to the number of Layouts you can have in the system or the number a User can have.

## Adding Layouts

- Select **Layouts** under the **Design** section of the main CMS menu.
- Click on the **Add Layout** button at the top of the grid to get started creating designs using the [Layout Editor.](layouts_editor.html)

{tip}
Did you knowâ€¦**.Layouts** and **Library files** can be [Assigned](displays.html#content-assign-files--layouts) directly to a **Display** or **Display Group** so that they are always available in the local library of the Player. Useful for pre-loading a Layout ahead of time ready to be scheduled.
{/tip}


## Resolutions

Layouts are designed for an intended display resolution and will function best when shown on a Display with a matching resolution. If they are shown on a Display that has a different resolution it will dynamically resize which may result in unused screen space.  

{tip}
Sending a Player a Layout that has been designed with a 4:3 resolution which is connected to a 16:9 TV screen would result in two empty bars either side of your content. 
{/tip}

Resolutions are selected for the Layout from the Properties Panel inside the [Layout Editor](layouts_editor.html).

[[PRODUCTNAME]] comes with a selection of default resolutions that cater for most digital signage applications.  

Resolutions can be added/edited and enabled/disabled by an Administrator from the **Resolutions** page under the **Design** section of the main CMS menu.

 ## Using Templates

[Templates](layouts_templates.html) are an easy way to speed up the design process and a great way to maintain a corporate image/standard.

Templates are selected from the [Toolbox](layouts_editor.html#content-toolbox) inside the Layout Editor.

{/tip}

## Layout Grid

Created Layouts can be viewed from **Layouts** under the **Design** section of the main CMS menu:

![Layout Grid](img/v4_layouts_grid.png)

Each Layout has a row menu which is used to access a menu of actions/shortcuts. This list will depend on whether the Layout is in a Draft or Published status, notable settings are listed below.

{tip}
Edit will open the form to make changes to Naming, Folders, Tags etc.
Use the **With Selected** option at the bottom of the Layout [grid](tour_cms_navigation.html#content-grids) to edit Tag assignments in bulk!
{/tip}

### Layouts in a Draft Status

**Design** - open the Layout Editor to make edits to the Layout.

**Publish** - Publish Now or select a future date and time to Publish.

{tip}
Administrators can use the default setting on the CMS **Settings** page to automatically **Publish** draft Layouts 30 minutes after the last edit!
{/tip}

**Discard** -  all changes will be discarded and the Layout will revert back to the previous Published version.

**Preview Draft Layout** - play a Preview of the Layout in its current **Draft** status.

### Layouts in a Published Status

**Design** - open the Layout in a **Read Only Mode**, Checkout the Layout to enable editing.

**Checkout** - create a draft to make edits to the Layout.

{tip}
Users can select the 'auto submit' check box so that this form is [automatically sent](tour_cms_navigation.html#content-automatic-submission-of-forms) each time that **Checkout** is selected. 
{/tip}

**Assign to Campaign** - add the Layout to an existing [Campaign](layouts_campaigns.html).

**Copy** - create copies to easily make modifications.  Choose to include all contained **Media** items, to use as a base for creating new Layouts to save time.

{tip}
Copying a Layout will create an exact copy at the last point the Layout was Published so ensure that you Publish a Layout before making a copy to preserve any changes!
{/tip}

**Retire** - retiring a Layout will not affect existing Campaigns/Schedules associated with the Layout. A retired Layout will be hidden from new Scheduling options but will remain unaffected in existing Schedules and continue to show on Displays.

**Export** - include all associated Widgets/Media/DataSet structures to a ZIP file, so it can be easily shared. 

{tip}
When exporting a Layout, all assigned **Layout**, **Playlist** and **Media Tags** will be exported. Select the **Import Tags** option to add these Tags on Layout Import.
Add the 'Export' [Feature](users_features_and_sharing.html) to allow a User/User Group to export regardless of the Share options that have been set for the Layout and its contents!
{/tip}

## FAQ's

**When should a User create a new Layout? When should a User add to an existing Layout?**
Layouts provide vast flexibility in the system. The recommended usage for a Layout is for it to only contain the design and media required for a set of related content that should be scheduled at the same time.

{tip}
**Scenario**:
You have a video showing a fire safety demonstration along with with some important text and a video and images showing an advert for an upcoming production - it would be natural to have separate Layouts for these.
{/tip}

**Are there any limits set for the amount of Layouts that can be created?**

[[PRODUCTNAME]] has no limit to the number of Layouts you can have in the system or the number a User/User Group can have.

**How do I view any retired Layouts?**

From the Layouts grid, use the Advanced tab and use the Retired filter. Use the row menu to unretire any Layouts.
