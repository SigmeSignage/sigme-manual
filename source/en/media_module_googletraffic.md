## Installation

The Google Traffic Module must be configured with a Google Maps API key before use. The "[get a key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)" documentation describes the process and differences between the keys.

The Google Traffic Module is installed from the **Modules** page under the **Administration** section of the main CMS menu. 

- Click on the **Install Module** button and select the Module to install.
- After installation, select the Module from the grid and use the row menu to select **Edit**.

- Complete the form fields and include the **API key**. 

This form also contains settings to provide a **default duration** and a **minimum duration**. Please make sure you understand these two settings and configure them in a suitable way for your environment.

{version}
**IMPORTANT:** The Google API is charged per map load and therefore how long the Widget remains on screen has a direct relation on the charges you will accrue.

{tip}
Until an API key is entered the Widget will not render in the Layout Editor or the Player, although you can still add the Widget to your Layouts.

This Module requires a **valid internet connection** on the Player in order to function.
{/tip}

The Google Maps API terms of use must be read and understood before using this Module. At the time of writing these terms can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms).
