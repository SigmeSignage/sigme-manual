# Display Groups

{tip}
**Please note:** If you are using a 3.x CMS, please use the following link: [Display Groups](displays_groups.html)
{/tip}

For ease of **Scheduling** and **Media Assignment** create Display Groups and assign Displays to one or multiple Display Groups. 

Display Groups are administered in the CMS by clicking on Display Settings under the Displays section on the Menu. The Display Group grid will open to Add and manage Display Groups.

## Add/Edit 

Click on the **Add Display Group** button to create a new Display Group or use the row menu to **Edit** an existing Display Group.

Display Groups can be [tagged](tour_tags.html) which allows for ordering and makes it easier to find. 

## Members

The membership of a Display Group is either a **Manual Assignment** or controlled by filter criteria using **Dynamic Groups**. 

### Dynamic Groups

When ticked an additional field will appear to allow for entry of one or more regular expressions to use to select which Displays belong to that Display Group.

Filter criteria for Dynamic Groups is in the format of regular expressions, but can also be simple string comparisons. The expressions should be separated by a comma and can be negated with a `-` prefix.

For example, all Displays containing "a" but not "b" would be `a,-b`.

### Manual Assignment

Use the row menu for the selected Display Group and click on **Members**. Tick/untick Displays or Nested Groups to add/remove membership from the Display Group.

The form shows **Displays** and **Display Groups** for nesting as well as a **Relationship Tree** making it easier to see the relationships of Displays.

## Nested Groups

Display Groups can be nested to create complex structures and allow for targeted Scheduling.

Example Group Structure

- Site 1
- Site 1 - Building A
- Site 1 - Building A - Level 1
- Site 1 - Building A - Level 2
- Site 1 - Building B

The Display membership is set on the lowest level Groups and those groups then belong to the next level up, which in turn belong to the highest level parent "Site 1".
The CMS will not allow a circular reference to be created - this is an assignment that creates a loop (i.e. Site 1 has Site 1 - Building A, and Site 1 - Building A has Site 1.)

**Schedules**, **Media** and **Layout Assignments** applied to the Display Group will apply to all its members and will appear for selection when Scheduling.
