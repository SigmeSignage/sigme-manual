**Please note:**

**Please note:** Playlists are only available from v2.0.0

Playlists allow for the creation of reusable playlists which can be easily added to Layouts and come in two parts:

1. **The Playlist** (contains the media content and configuration)
2. **The Sub-Playlist Widget** (allows for defined Playlists to be added to Layouts)

Playlists are first defined, which can then be reused across multiple Regions and Layouts. Access by navigating to **Playlists** under the **Library** section of the menu to view the Playlists grid where you can add new and manage existing Playlists.

Click on the **Add Playlist** button and complete the form fields:

Playlists can be tagged which allows for ordering and makes it easier to find and view a large number of Playlists if grouped by a certain [Tag](tour_tags_2.html). 

If you require media assignments to be managed automatically then tick the **Dynamic** check box and set the filter criteria to use for Library media on the **Filter** tab.

You can prepopulate your playlist with media from the Library using the **Filter** tab, but leaving the Dynamic checkbox unticked to make it a one-time assignment.

Once added use the row menu for your created Playlist and click on **Timeline**.

Change the playlist Timeline order by clicking on an item and dragging it to the desired positioning. As changes are autosaved use the Undo button, located on the bottom right of the toolbar to revert any changes made.

Use the [Tools](layouts_tools.html) tab to apply **Actions** such as **Audio**/**Permissions** and **Expiry Dates** to the items added to the timeline.
{/tip}

From v2.2, use the **Select Multiple Widgets** button on the bottom toolbar to select and delete multiple items from the Playlist.

Easily make copies of Playlists by using the **Copy** button from the row menu.

![Copy Playlists](img/v2_media_playlists_copy.png)



Use the tick box to make **new copies** of all media assigned to the original playlist so that you can make adjustments as needed to create a new Playlist.

Include pre-defined Playlists by adding the [Sub-Playlist Widget](media_module_subplaylist.html) to Layouts.
